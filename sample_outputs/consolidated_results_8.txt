# Fact-Check Summary: Incorrect Presumptions Only

## Presumption 1: Colonoscopy is the only way to screen for colon cancer
**Status: INCORRECT**

**Key Facts:**
- Multiple effective screening methods exist, including stool-based tests (FIT, gFOBT, Cologuard), imaging tests (CT colonography, flexible sigmoidoscopy), and colonoscopy
- The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gives FIT and colonoscopy equal "A" grade recommendations
- Medical guidelines emphasize that the best screening test is the one that gets done consistently

## Presumption 2: Colonoscopies are a necessary test for colon cancer screening
**Status: INCORRECT**

**Key Facts:**
- While colonoscopy is the "gold standard," it's not the only necessary screening method
- Major medical organizations recommend multiple screening options without specifying colonoscopy as the only acceptable method
- Studies show stool-based tests and other methods can effectively reduce colorectal cancer mortality when used consistently
- The key is regular screening with any appropriate method, not specifically colonoscopy
