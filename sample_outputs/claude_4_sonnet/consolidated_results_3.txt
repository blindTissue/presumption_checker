## Incorrect Presumptions Summary

### 1. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer requires immediate surgery
**Key Facts:**
- Multiple treatment options exist including trimodal therapy (resection + chemotherapy + radiation) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy
- Even when surgery is chosen, it's typically planned within 12 weeks, not performed immediately
- Treatment selection depends on patient factors like age, health status, tumor characteristics, and patient preference
- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy often precedes surgery and can delay it by 3-4 months while improving outcomes

### 2. Surgery is the primary/only treatment option for muscle-invasive bladder cancer
**Key Facts:**
- Trimodal therapy (bladder-sparing approach) shows comparable survival outcomes to surgery in selected patients
- Treatment options include radical cystectomy, trimodal therapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and immunotherapy
- Medical guidelines recognize both surgical and bladder-sparing approaches as viable options
- 5-year survival rates for trimodal therapy reach 50-60% in appropriate candidates

*Note: The presumption about significant recovery time for bladder cancer surgery was found to be accurate and is therefore omitted from this summary.*
