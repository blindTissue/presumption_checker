## FACT-CHECK SUMMARY

**INCORRECT PRESUMPTION IDENTIFIED:**

**Surgery as the only treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer**

**Key Facts:**
- Multiple treatment options exist beyond surgery
- **Trimodal therapy** (resection + chemotherapy + radiation) offers comparable survival rates while preserving bladder function
- **Neoadjuvant chemotherapy** improves outcomes when combined with definitive treatment
- **Immunotherapy** available for patients unsuitable for cisplatin-based chemotherapy
- Treatment selection depends on tumor characteristics, patient health, and personal preferences

**Evidence:**
- Radical cystectomy has 5-year survival rates of 60-70% for organ-confined disease
- Bladder-sparing approaches achieve similar survival rates in selected patients
- Multidisciplinary care involving urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists is standard
- Some patients cannot undergo major surgery due to age or health conditions
