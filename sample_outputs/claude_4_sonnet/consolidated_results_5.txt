## Incorrect Presumptions Summary

**1. All people with colorectal cancer require a permanent colostomy bag**
- **Key Facts**: Only 5-15% of colorectal cancer patients require permanent colostomy; 20-30% have temporary colostomies that are often reversed; 70-80% undergo surgery preserving normal bowel function
- **Evidence**: Modern surgical techniques like sphincter-sparing procedures have dramatically reduced permanent colostomy rates over the past 20-30 years

**2. Colostomy bags are always a lifelong requirement after colorectal cancer treatment**
- **Key Facts**: Many colostomies are temporary (60-80% successfully reversed after 3-6 months); only 10-15% of all colorectal cancer patients require permanent colostomies
- **Evidence**: For rectal cancers specifically, modern surgical techniques allow sphincter preservation in 70-80% of cases

**3. Colostomy bags create significant travel restrictions**
- **Key Facts**: No restrictions on destinations or transportation modes; TSA/international security accommodate medical devices; airlines cannot discriminate against passengers with medical devices
- **Evidence**: Legal protections exist (ADA, international regulations); modern ostomy technology designed for active lifestyles; millions travel regularly without major issues

**4. Standard travel insurance excludes coverage for people with colostomy bags**
- **Key Facts**: Stable colostomies (established >12 months) usually covered without restrictions; major insurers assess based on underlying conditions, not the colostomy itself
- **Evidence**: Anti-discrimination laws (ADA, UK Equality Act) prevent blanket exclusions; millions with colostomies obtain standard travel insurance

**5. Specialized lifelong travel insurance policies exist specifically for colostomy users**
- **Key Facts**: No colostomy-specific insurance products exist; coverage provided through standard medical travel insurance for pre-existing conditions
- **Evidence**: Industry uses inclusive approach covering various pre-existing conditions rather than creating separate product lines for each medical condition
