# Fact-Check Summary

**Incorrect Presumption Found:**

**Colorectal cancer diagnosis means imminent death or prolonged absence from children**

**Key Facts & Evidence:**
- Overall 5-year survival rate is approximately 65%
- Early-stage (localized) survival rate is about 91%  
- Regional spread survival rate is approximately 72%
- About 73% of cases are diagnosed at localized or regional stages
- Modern treatments allow many patients to maintain normal activities during treatment
- Most patients continue being present, engaged parents throughout their treatment journey
- Treatment typically spans months, not years, with many returning to normal activities after completion

**Bottom Line:** The presumption reflects outdated assumptions and fails to account for significant medical advances and high survival rates in colorectal cancer treatment.
