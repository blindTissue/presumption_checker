# Fact-Check Summary: Incorrect Presumptions About CLL Treatment

## Incorrect Presumption: Bone Marrow Transplant as Primary CLL Treatment

**Key Facts:**
- Bone marrow transplant is **NOT** the primary treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
- Primary treatments include: watch-and-wait surveillance, targeted therapies (BTK inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors), immunotherapy, and chemotherapy combinations
- Transplant is reserved only for select patients under 70 with high-risk or relapsed/refractory disease
- CLL primarily affects older adults (median age ~70), making most patients ineligible for transplant

**Evidence:**
- Transplant is considered in <5-10% of CLL patients
- Treatment-related mortality ranges from 5-20%
- Modern targeted therapies have dramatically improved outcomes without transplant risks
- Major treatment guidelines list transplant as a later-line option, not first-line

**Bottom Line:** The original question incorrectly assumes bone marrow transplant is the standard treatment for CLL, when it's actually a specialized procedure used only in specific high-risk situations for a small subset of younger patients.
