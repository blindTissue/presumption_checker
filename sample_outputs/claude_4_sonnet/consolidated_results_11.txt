# Fact-Check Summary: Incorrect Presumptions About Kidney Cancer Treatment

## Incorrect Presumption: Dialysis is Required for Early-Stage Kidney Cancer Treatment

**Key Facts:**
- Early-stage kidney cancer is primarily treated with surgery (partial or radical nephrectomy), not dialysis
- Most people can live normally with one healthy kidney, which typically compensates by increasing function
- Dialysis is used for kidney failure, not as a cancer treatment
- About 95% of kidney cancers occur in only one kidney, leaving the other to maintain adequate function

**Evidence:**
- Dialysis is only needed when kidney function drops below 10-15% of normal capacity
- A single healthy kidney can maintain 70-80% of normal kidney function
- Modern surgical techniques prioritize preserving healthy kidney tissue
- Dialysis may only be necessary in rare circumstances: bilateral kidney cancer, pre-existing kidney disease, or surgical complications affecting remaining kidney function

**Bottom Line:** The underlying assumption that dialysis is a standard or necessary part of early-stage kidney cancer treatment is medically inaccurate. Most patients with early-stage kidney cancer undergo surgical treatment without ever requiring dialysis.
