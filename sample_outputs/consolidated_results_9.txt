# Fact-Check Summary: Incorrect Presumptions About Stage IV Colorectal Cancer

## 1. Treatment Options Beyond Palliative Care
**Incorrect presumption:** Palliative care is the only treatment option for stage IV colorectal cancer.

**Key facts:** Multiple active treatments exist including:
- Systemic chemotherapy (FOLFOX, FOLFIRI combinations)
- Targeted therapies (bevacizumab, cetuximab for specific tumor types)
- Immunotherapy for MSI-H tumors
- Surgical resection of metastases when feasible
- Local ablative therapies (radiofrequency ablation, SBRT)

Modern oncology integrates palliative care alongside active treatment rather than as an alternative.

## 2. Prognosis and Survival
**Incorrect presumption:** Stage IV diagnosis means inevitable near-term death.

**Key facts:** 
- 5-year survival rate is 14-20% overall
- Median survival now 24-30+ months with modern treatment (vs. 6-12 months decades ago)
- Some patients achieve long-term survival or cure, especially with resectable metastatic disease
- Outcomes vary significantly based on metastases location, patient health, and tumor genetics

## 3. Curative Potential
**Incorrect presumption:** No curative or life-extending treatments are available.

**Key facts:**
- Surgical resection offers 25-60% five-year survival when metastases can be completely removed
- Liver metastasectomy: 35-50% five-year survival rates
- Lung metastasectomy: 40-68% five-year survival rates
- ~20-25% of stage IV patients may be candidates for potentially curative surgery
- Median survival improved from ~12 months (1990s) to ~30 months currently

## 4. Scope of Palliative Care
**Incorrect presumption:** Palliative care only manages pain.

**Key facts:** Comprehensive services include:
- Management of multiple symptoms (nausea, fatigue, breathing issues)
- Psychosocial and spiritual support
- Family counseling and caregiver assistance
- Care coordination across providers
- Quality of life and communication support
- Can be provided alongside curative treatments, not just end-of-life care
