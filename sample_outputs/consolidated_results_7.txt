# Fact-Check Summary: Incorrect Presumptions About Colonoscopy

## Incorrect Presumption 1: Colonoscopy is the only reliable method for colon cancer screening

**Key Facts:**
- Multiple reliable screening methods exist and are recommended by major medical organizations
- Alternatives include: Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), stool DNA tests (Cologuard), CT colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy
- The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gives "A" ratings to multiple screening methods
- Studies show FIT reduces colorectal cancer mortality by 9-23%, and stool DNA tests detect 92% of colorectal cancers

## Incorrect Presumption 2: Colonoscopy is unavoidable/necessary for colon cancer screening

**Key Facts:**
- Several effective screening alternatives exist that are endorsed by the American Cancer Society and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
- Alternative methods are less invasive, require no sedation, and have better patient compliance rates
- While alternatives may have limitations (higher false positive rates, less comprehensive), they remain effective screening options
- Colonoscopy often becomes necessary only for diagnostic follow-up when other tests show abnormal results

**Bottom Line:** Multiple reliable screening options exist beyond colonoscopy, making it not the only or unavoidable choice for colon cancer screening.
