## Incorrect Presumptions - Fact-Check Summary

**4 out of 5 presumptions were found to be incorrect:**

### 1. Hospice Care and Treatment Exhaustion
**Incorrect presumption:** Choosing hospice means all treatments have been exhausted or are ineffective.

**Key facts:** Hospice care is about patient choice to focus on comfort rather than medical futility. Patients can choose hospice while curative treatments are still available, and the decision often reflects personal values about quality vs. quantity of life.

### 2. Immediate Hospice Transition 
**Incorrect presumption:** It's medically appropriate to go directly to hospice upon lung cancer diagnosis without exploring treatments.

**Key facts:** Standard medical practice requires staging the cancer and discussing available treatment options first. Even advanced lung cancer often has treatments that can extend life and improve quality of life. Medical ethics require informed consent about all options.

### 3. Treatment Refusal = Automatic Hospice Eligibility
**Incorrect presumption:** Declining treatment automatically qualifies patients for hospice regardless of stage or prognosis.

**Key facts:** Hospice requires a terminal diagnosis with 6-month life expectancy certified by physicians. Early-stage patients who refuse treatment may still live years. Treatment refusal is often required for hospice but isn't the sole qualifying factor - terminal prognosis remains the primary criterion.

### 4. Treatment Ineffectiveness Assumption
**Incorrect presumption:** Treatment "won't make a difference" for lung cancer patients across all stages and types.

**Key facts:** This is a harmful oversimplification. Stage I lung cancer has 60-92% five-year survival rates. Modern treatments including targeted therapies and immunotherapy have significantly improved outcomes. Even advanced cases often benefit from treatment for symptom relief and life extension.
