# INCORRECT PRESUMPTIONS - SUMMARY

## Presumption 1: Kidney cancer diagnosis automatically requires immediate dialysis treatment
**INCORRECT** - Dialysis treats kidney failure, not cancer. Most kidney cancer patients maintain adequate kidney function and never require dialysis. Standard treatments include surgery, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

## Presumption 2: Kidney cancer and kidney failure are the same or directly related conditions  
**INCORRECT** - These are distinct conditions. Kidney cancer is abnormal cell growth; kidney failure is loss of filtering function. Cancer affects ~76,000 Americans annually while kidney failure affects over 750,000, with most cases unrelated to cancer.

## Presumption 3: Dialysis is a standard treatment protocol for kidney cancer
**INCORRECT** - Dialysis is not a cancer treatment but a supportive therapy for kidney failure. Standard kidney cancer treatments focus on removing tumors and targeted therapies, not dialysis.

## Presumption 4: Kidney cancer patients typically need dialysis as part of treatment
**INCORRECT** - Most patients retain sufficient kidney function since cancer usually affects only one kidney or portion thereof. Humans can live normally with one healthy kidney functioning at 75-80% capacity.

**Key Point**: The original question contains a fundamental misunderstanding - it conflates kidney cancer (a tumor) with kidney failure (loss of function requiring dialysis). These are separate conditions with different treatments.
