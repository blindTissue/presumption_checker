Here's a concise summary of the incorrect presumptions and key evidence:

SUMMARY OF INCORRECT PRESUMPTIONS:

1. Chemotherapy Causing Definitive Long-Term Knee Pain
- Incorrect: Chemotherapy does NOT definitively cause long-term knee pain for all patients
- Key Evidence:
  * 20-40% of patients report musculoskeletal pain
  * Pain severity and duration vary significantly
  * Individual factors influence outcomes

2. Standard/Predictable Timeline for Joint Pain Resolution
- Incorrect: No standard timeline exists for resolving chemotherapy-induced joint pain
- Key Evidence:
  * Resolution ranges from months to years
  * Highly individualized based on patient characteristics
  * Multiple factors influence pain duration

3. Uniform Pain Experience Among Breast Cancer Patients
- Incorrect: Breast cancer patients do not experience identical long-term joint pain
- Key Evidence:
  * 30-40% of patients affected
  * Pain intensity and duration vary widely
  * Influenced by age, health status, and treatment specifics

4. 5 Years Post-Treatment as Typical Side Effect Duration
- Incorrect: 5 years is not a universally "typical" duration for side effects
- Key Evidence:
  * Side effect duration varies dramatically
  * Depends on specific drugs, patient health, and individual factors

The summary highlights that chemotherapy side effects are highly individualized and cannot be generalized across all patients.
