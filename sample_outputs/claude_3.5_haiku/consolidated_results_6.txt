2. Terminal Prognosis Determination
- Incorrect: Insufficient medical context to declare terminal status
- Key Requirements for Terminal Prognosis:
  • Comprehensive medical evaluation
  • Professional medical diagnosis
  • Individual patient circumstances

3. Treatment Limitations on Life Expectancy
- Insufficient Information: No specific details provided to evaluate treatment impacts

5. Life-Extending Interventions
- Inconclusive: Requires specific patient medical details
- Cannot recommend interventions without comprehensive medical context

8 & 9. Prognosis and Outcome Discussions

Key Takeaway: Most presumptions require individualized medical consultation and cannot be generalized without specific patient information.

Recommended Action: Direct consultation with healthcare providers for personalized medical guidance.
