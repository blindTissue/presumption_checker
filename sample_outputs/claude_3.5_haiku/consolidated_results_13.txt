Here's a concise version focusing on incorrect presumptions:

INCORRECT PRESUMPTIONS:

4. INACCURATE PRESUMPTION: 
Kidney cancer surgery always results in the entire kidney being removed

Key Facts and Evidence:
- Partial nephrectomy (removing only the tumor) is often possible
- Surgical approach depends on:
  * Tumor size
  * Location
  * Cancer stage
  * Patient's overall health
- Preservation of kidney function is preferred when feasible
- Multiple surgical techniques available (minimally invasive, robotic-assisted)

All other presumptions were found to be accurate and do not require summary.

Recommendation: Consult urological oncology specialists for personalized surgical approach.
