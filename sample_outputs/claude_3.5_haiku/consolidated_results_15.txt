CONCISE FACT-CHECK SUMMARY:

Incorrect Presumptions:

1. Lung Cancer Treatability:
- Lung cancer is NOT always untreatable at late stages
- Treatment options include chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy
- Survival rates vary: Stage 3 (19-36%), Stage 4 (around 7%)
- Effectiveness depends on cancer type, patient health, and genetic factors

2. Treatment Responsiveness:
- Not all lung cancer cases are equally unresponsive
- Response varies by cancer type, stage, and genetic mutations
- Early-stage lung cancers have up to 60-70% 5-year survival rates
- Personalized medicine approaches are increasingly successful

3. Hospice Care Limitations:
- Hospice does NOT automatically exclude patients who might benefit from medical intervention
- Focuses on comfort and quality of life
- Can provide symptom management and holistic care
- Patients can transition in and out of hospice care

6. Advanced Treatment Approaches:
- Specialized lung cancer treatments exist beyond traditional methods
- Include targeted therapies, immunotherapy, molecular profiling
- Effectiveness varies by individual patient characteristics
- Ongoing research continues to expand treatment options

7. Hospice Service Admission:
- Hospice services do not uniformly accept patients
- Require terminal diagnosis, medical confirmation, patient agreement
- Eligibility criteria vary between providers
- Palliative care can be an intermediate option

Recommendation: Consult oncology specialists for personalized treatment strategies.
