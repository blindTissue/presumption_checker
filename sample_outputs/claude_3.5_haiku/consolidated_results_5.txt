2. Travel Insurance Challenges:
Incorrect Presumption: Colostomy bags create significant travel challenges requiring specialized insurance.
Key Facts:

- Challenges are primarily logistical, not insurance-related
- Specialized insurance is not typically necessary

3. Treatment Outcomes:
Incorrect Presumption: Colorectal cancer treatment always requires a permanent colostomy.
Key Facts:
- Only 30-40% of patients might require a permanent colostomy
- Surgical techniques have advanced to preserve bowel function
- Treatment depends on cancer stage, tumor location, and individual factors

4. Insurance Restrictions:
Incorrect Presumption: Travel insurance is universally restrictive for individuals with colostomy.
Key Facts:
