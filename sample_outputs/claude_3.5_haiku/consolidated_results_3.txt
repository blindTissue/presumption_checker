Here's a concise version focusing on incorrect presumptions:

SUMMARY OF INCORRECT PRESUMPTIONS:

INCORRECT FACTS:
- Treatment is individualized
- Options include:
  * Surgical removal
  * Multimodal therapy
  * Chemotherapy
  * Radiation therapy
- Requires multidisciplinary team consultation

4. Presumption: All muscle-invasive bladder cancer cases are treated with the same surgical approach
INCORRECT FACTS:
- Surgical approach varies based on:
  * Tumor stage
  * Tumor location
  * Patient's overall health
  * Age
  * Kidney function
- Surgical options include:
  * Radical cystectomy
  * Partial cystectomy
  * Neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatments

Key Evidence: Treatment must be personalized, with multiple factors influencing surgical strategy.

Note: Presumptions 2, 3, 5, and 6 were found to be accurate or reasonably structured and thus not included in this summary.
