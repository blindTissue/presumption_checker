# Concise Fact-Check Summary

**Incorrect Presumption Found:**

**Presumption 2: Significance of long-term health effects with one kidney**
- **Finding**: PARTIALLY ACCURATE - overstates severity
- **Key Facts**: 
  - Many people with one kidney live normal, healthy lives with proper care
  - Increased risks exist but as statistical possibilities, not inevitable outcomes:
    - 2-3x higher risk of hypertension
    - 15-25% may develop some kidney function decline
    - 20-30% may experience protein in urine
  - The remaining kidney typically compensates by increasing function 70-80%
  - Life expectancy is generally not significantly reduced
  - Outcomes vary significantly by cause (donation vs. disease removal vs. congenital)

**Note**: The other 3 presumptions (nephrectomy as standard treatment, ability to live normally with one kidney, and need for ongoing monitoring) were found to be accurate.
