## Fact-Check Summary: Incorrect Presumptions About Prostate Cancer Treatment

**Presumption 1: Surgery is inevitable for all prostate cancer diagnoses**
- **Incorrect.** Many men with prostate cancer never undergo surgery
- Treatment varies based on cancer stage/grade, patient age, health status, and preferences
- Common alternatives include active surveillance, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy
- Low-risk cancers often require monitoring only, not immediate treatment

**Presumption 2: Prostate cancer surgery always requires significant work-impacting recovery**
- **Partially incorrect.** Recovery varies considerably by procedure type and work demands
- Minimally invasive procedures: 2-4 weeks for office work vs. 6-8 weeks for physical labor
- 60-80% of patients return to work within 4-6 weeks after minimally invasive procedures
- Office workers often return within 2-3 weeks, sometimes working from home earlier

**Presumption 3: Immediate surgical intervention is always necessary upon diagnosis**
- **Incorrect.** Active surveillance is recommended for most low-risk prostate cancers
- Treatment timing depends on cancer characteristics, patient factors, and risk level
- Many slow-growing cancers may never become life-threatening
- Studies show active surveillance has similar survival rates to immediate treatment for appropriate candidates
