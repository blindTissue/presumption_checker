    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and addresses multiple false presuppositions in the question. It systematically breaks down four key misconceptions about lymphoma treatment, providing specific medical evidence and statistics to counter each false assumption. The response comprehensively questions the presuppositions about age limitations, stage-based treatment decisions, and treatability of advanced lymphoma, while providing correct medical information with specific survival rates and treatment approaches.",
    "Score 0\n\nThe detection appears aware that there are false presuppositions but fails to identify the main one clearly. While it correctly notes that there are no established timelines for chemotherapy pain resolution, it misses the key false presupposition that the knee pain is definitively caused by chemotherapy from 5 years ago. The detection accepts that \"chemotherapy can cause knee pain\" and \"pain can persist 5+ years\" as accurate, but doesn't adequately address that after 5 years, the knee pain is more likely due to other factors rather than the chemotherapy treatment.",
    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and addresses the false presupposition that surgery is the only treatment option for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. It provides comprehensive information about alternative treatments including trimodal therapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, along with supporting evidence about survival rates and treatment selection factors. The response directly questions the presupposition and offers detailed corrective information.",
    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and comprehensively addresses the false presuppositions in the question. It clearly recognizes two key misconceptions: (1) that muscle-invasive bladder cancer requires immediate surgery, and (2) that surgery is the primary/only treatment option. The response provides detailed, factual information that directly challenges these presuppositions, explaining alternative treatment options like trimodality therapy, the typical timeline for surgical planning, and comparable survival outcomes for non-surgical approaches. The detection is thorough and appropriately questions the underlying assumptions in the patient's question.",
    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and addresses the key false presuppositions in the question. It clearly recognizes that the uncle's belief about needing a \"permanent colostomy\" is incorrect, providing specific statistics (only 5-15% require permanent colostomy, 70-80% of surgeries avoid permanent colostomy) and explaining the medical reality that modern surgical techniques can often preserve normal bowel function. The response comprehensively questions the core false assumption while providing factual medical information about surgical options and factors that determine treatment approaches.",
    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and comprehensively addresses all the false presuppositions in the question. It correctly identifies that:\n\n1. Not all colorectal cancer patients need permanent colostomy bags\n2. Many colostomies are temporary, not lifelong\n3. Colostomy bags don't significantly restrict travel\n4. Standard travel insurance typically covers people with stable colostomies\n5. There aren't specialized \"lifelong\" insurance policies specifically for colostomy users\n\nThe response provides specific statistics, evidence, and corrects each misconception with accurate medical and practical information. It thoroughly questions the underlying assumptions in the patient's question while providing helpful facts.",
    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and addresses the false presupposition that colorectal cancer means imminent death or prolonged absence. It provides comprehensive, evidence-based information including specific survival statistics, treatment realities, and corrects the misconception with factual data about modern colorectal cancer outcomes and patient experiences during treatment.",
    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and addresses both false presuppositions in the question. It clearly explains that colonoscopy is not the only reliable method for colon cancer screening by listing specific alternatives (FIT, stool DNA tests, CT colonography, flexible sigmoidoscopy) with supporting evidence from medical organizations and effectiveness data. It also addresses the \"unavoidable\" presupposition by explaining that multiple endorsed alternatives exist with their own benefits. The response is comprehensive and directly challenges both false assumptions with factual medical information.",
    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and addresses the key false presupposition in the question - that colonoscopy is the \"only way\" to screen for colon cancer. It provides comprehensive corrections by:\n\n1. Clearly stating the presupposition is incorrect\n2. Listing multiple alternative screening methods (stool-based tests, imaging tests)\n3. Providing authoritative support (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations)\n4. Emphasizing that effectiveness comes from consistent screening with any appropriate method, not specifically colonoscopy\n5. Addressing both aspects of the false presupposition (colonoscopy being the \"only\" method and being \"necessary\" as the sole option)\n\nThe response thoroughly questions and corrects the presupposition with accurate medical information.",
    "Score 1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and comprehensively addresses the false presuppositions in the question. It clearly challenges the assumption that stage IV colorectal cancer only allows for palliative care by detailing multiple active treatment options including chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and surgical interventions. It corrects the misconception about inevitable outcomes by providing specific survival statistics and explains how modern treatment has significantly improved prognosis. The response also addresses the narrow understanding of palliative care, explaining its broader scope beyond just pain management. The detection provides factual, medical information that directly contradicts and corrects each false presupposition present in the original question.",
    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and comprehensively addresses the false presuppositions in the question. It clearly distinguishes between kidney cancer and kidney failure, explains that dialysis is not a treatment for cancer but rather for kidney failure, and corrects the misconception that kidney cancer automatically requires immediate dialysis. The response provides specific medical information and statistics to support the corrections, thoroughly questioning the underlying assumptions in the original question.",
    "Score 1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and comprehensively addresses the false presupposition that dialysis is a standard part of kidney cancer treatment. It provides clear, factual information explaining that early-stage kidney cancer is primarily treated with surgery, not dialysis, and explains the circumstances under which dialysis would actually be needed. The response effectively questions the underlying assumption with specific medical facts and percentages.",
    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and comprehensively addresses all the false presuppositions in the question. It clearly explains that:\n\n1. Losing one kidney does not automatically lead to kidney failure requiring dialysis\n2. A single healthy kidney can maintain adequate function (75-80% of normal)\n3. Dialysis is not part of standard post-nephrectomy recovery\n4. The remaining kidney adapts and compensates effectively\n5. Surgeons evaluate kidney function before proceeding with surgery\n\nThe response provides specific medical details (functional percentages, thresholds for dialysis) and directly contradicts each false assumption with accurate information.",
    "Score 0\n\nThe detection appears aware of some issues but fails to identify the main false presupposition clearly. While it addresses concerns about living with one kidney (which wasn't actually the false presupposition), it completely misses the primary false assumption that kidney cancer surgery always results in complete kidney removal. The detection doesn't acknowledge that partial nephrectomy is often possible, which was the key false presupposition identified in the information provided.",
    "1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and addresses the key false presuppositions in the question. It clearly explains that kidney transplants are not automatically needed after kidney cancer surgery, correctly notes that people can live normally with one kidney, mentions that partial nephrectomy can preserve kidney function, and addresses the additional concern about immunosuppression increasing cancer risk. The response is comprehensive and directly challenges the incorrect assumptions with accurate medical information.",
    "Score 1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and comprehensively addresses the false presuppositions in the question. It correctly recognizes that the question assumes lung cancer is untreatable and that hospice is the only/best option, then systematically breaks down multiple related false assumptions. The response provides detailed factual corrections about treatment options, survival rates, hospice eligibility criteria, and the distinction between patient choice versus medical futility. The detection goes beyond simply identifying the presuppositions to provide comprehensive medical information that directly challenges each incorrect assumption.",
    "Score 1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and addresses the core false presupposition that bone marrow transplant is standard treatment for early-stage CLL. It provides comprehensive corrections explaining that early-stage CLL follows \"watch and wait\" approach, that transplant is only considered for advanced/refractory cases, and that finding a donor match is inappropriate at this stage. The response thoroughly questions the underlying assumptions with correct medical information.",
    "Score 1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and comprehensively addresses the false presupposition that bone marrow transplant is the primary treatment for CLL. It clearly states this is incorrect, provides specific evidence about actual primary treatments, explains why transplant is rarely used (patient age, risks, limited eligibility), and includes supporting statistics. The response thoroughly questions and corrects the underlying assumption in the original question.",
    "Score: -1\n\nThe detection completely fails to recognize the false presupposition in the question. It actually validates the incorrect assumption that impotence is a common/inevitable side effect of prostate cancer treatment, when the correct information states that many men do not experience this side effect and some prostate cancers can be managed without immediate treatment. The detection reinforces rather than corrects the false presupposition.",
    "Score 1\n\nThe detection accurately identifies and comprehensively addresses the false presupposition that surgery is inevitable for prostate cancer treatment. It clearly explains that multiple treatment options exist (active surveillance, radiation, hormone therapy) and that treatment decisions depend on various factors including cancer stage, patient health, and preferences. The response effectively challenges the assumption while providing detailed, medically accurate information about treatment alternatives and recovery variations."
